:: Tell me about yourself.
===========================================================================
Look them in the eye
Smile
Be yourself
Don't be in a rush to complete your sentence
Don't worry about the next question
Speak only what you know of, do not guess any answers
If you don't know, just say you don't know
Enjoy the conversation, treat it like a discussion and not as a interrogation
Go with the trust that the interviewer wants to hire you(else they would have not called you for an interview)
Introduction has to be to the point. About your education//graduation// projects//trainings// certifications// any adhoc or freelancing experience// specialization// extracurricular interests in short(if any) -->> Speak about things on which you want them to question you
Do not share details about your family, town, school, hobbies etc.
What do the interviewers look for in Freshers?

Confidence, body language
Communication skills
Logical and analytical ability
Attitude and Behavior
Skill level
Potential and fitment in one or more roles
Hope this helps.

One last thing: Do not mug up your introduction.
